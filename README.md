This repository contains my practice projects and experiments with Generative AI using LangChain.
It includes different implementations like:

🔍 RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

💬 Chatbots with message history

🧩 Prompt engineering experiments

1st. Implemented RAG(Retrieval Argumented Generation) : RAG is AI Framework used to provide external context to model and give response over that context. RAG is implemented in 6 stages: 1. Ingestion 2. Splitting 3. Embeddings 4. storing 5. retriving 6. generation

2nd. Implemented LCEL(Langchain expression Language) : it help to create chain from a langchain feacture or components. Understand Runnables. It is something that can be chained means every components in langchain are not supports chaining so Runnable make them to support chain and make model more convinient.

3rd Implemented Chatbot with message history actually via creating session for a single chat.
